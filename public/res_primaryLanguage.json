    "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Joshua Huston. I came to Code Fellows after gaining exposure to technical products and teams through my work at Zillow. I currently work as an apprentice software engineer, data analyst, and an officer in the Army National Guard. My goal is to learn front-end development, then go on to learn Python in 401. In the future, I will work for Zillow as a Software Engineer and potentially transition into the Cyber Branch in the Army to help use my technical skills for cyber defense.",
